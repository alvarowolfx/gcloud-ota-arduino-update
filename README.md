### Setup Google cloud tools and project

* Install beta components:
    * `gcloud components install beta`
* Authenticate with Google Cloud:
    * `gcloud auth login`
* Create cloud project — choose your unique project name:
    * `gcloud projects create YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`
* Set current project
    * `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`

* Cloud Build Setup :
  * Open the Cloud Build page.
  * Enable Cloud Build API if not enabled yet.
  * Select the Triggers tab.
  * Click on Create Trigger.
  * Now you can select your Git repository and authenticate with your provider. I used Github.
  * On the last step, Trigger Settings, let’s create a trigger by git tags.
  * Name it — “Trigger by Build Tag”.
  * Select Tag as the Trigger type.
  * Select cloudbuild.yaml as the Build configuration type.
  * Click on Create Trigger.

* Cloud Storage Setup :
  * Now Open the Cloud Storage page
  * Select the Browser Tab.
  * Click on Create bucket.
  * Create a bucket with the name YOUR_PROJECT_NAME-firmwaresand select the let the other values as the defaults. In my case, the name of the bucket was gcloud-ota-update-firmwares.
  * Click on Create.

### Deploy Cloud Functions

* Run on the command line:
```
./deploy-prod.sh
```

### Upload firmware with PlatfomIO

I recommend installing the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) IDE and the PlatformIO plugin to get started using it. Just follow the step on the link below:

https://platformio.org/platformio-ide

To deploy to the board you can use the “Build” and “Upload” buttons on PlatformIO Toolbar.
